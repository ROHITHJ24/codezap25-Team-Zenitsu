TEAM ZENITSU – GIT RULES FOR HACKATHON
1. Pull Before Starting Work

Always run git pull before coding.

Announce in chat: "Starting work on [feature]".
Why: Prevents merge conflicts and duplicate work.

2. Commit Often with Clear Messages

Commit after each small feature works.

Use descriptive messages like: "Added login button" or "Fixed search bar bug".
Why: Easy to track changes and debug quickly.

3. Test Before Pushing

Test code locally before pushing.

If a feature isn’t complete, mark it as "WIP: [feature]".
Why: Prevents broken code from affecting the team.

4. Update Trello & Communicate

Update Trello when starting/finishing features.

Send quick chat messages about progress.
Why: Keeps the team synced and avoids overlapping work.

5. Golden Rules

❌ No force push unless approved.

❌ Don’t commit passwords/API keys.

❌ Don’t delete branches without team approval.

❌ Resolve conflicts together — don’t guess alone.
